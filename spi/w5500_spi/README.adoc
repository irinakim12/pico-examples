= Attaching a W5500 via SPI

This example code shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico to the WIZ850io(W5500) board. The particular device used can be interfaced via SPI, we are using SPI, and interfacing at 3.3v.

[NOTE]
======
This is a very basic example, and only recovers raw data from the sensor. There are various calibration options available that should be used to ensure that the final results are accurate. It is also possible to wire up the interrupt pin to a GPIO and read data only when it is ready, rather than using the polling approach in the example.
======

== Wiring information

Wiring up the device requires 6 jumpers as follows:

   * GPIO 4 (pin 6) MISO/spi0_rx-> ADO on WIZ850io(W5500) board
   * GPIO 5 (pin 7) Chip select -> NCS on WIZ850io(W5500) board
   * GPIO 6 (pin 9) SCK/spi0_sclk -> SCL on WIZ850io(W5500) board
   * GPIO 7 (pin 10) MOSI/spi0_tx -> SDA on WIZ850io(W5500) board
   * 3.3v (pin 36) -> VCC on WIZ850io(W5500) board
   * GND (pin 38)  -> GND on WIZ850io(W5500) board

The example here uses SPI port 0. Power is supplied from the 3.3V pin.

[NOTE]
======
There are many different manufacturers who sell boards with the WIZ850io(W5500). Whilst they all appear slightly different, they all have, at least, the same 6 pins required to power and communicate. When wiring up a board that is different to the one in the diagram, ensure you connect up as described in the previous paragraph.
